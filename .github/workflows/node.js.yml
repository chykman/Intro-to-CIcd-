# Name of the workflow, displayed in the GitHub Actions UI
name: Node.js CI

# Specifies when the workflow should be triggered
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on 'push' events to the 'main' branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Limits the trigger to the 'main' branch only
  # Also triggers the workflow on 'pull_request' events targeting the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]  # Limits the trigger to pull requests targeting 'main'

# Defines the jobs that the workflow will execute
jobs:
  # Job identifier, can be any name (here it's 'build')
  build:
    # Specifies the type of virtual host environment (runner) to use
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Uses the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub

    # Strategy for running the jobs - useful for testing across multiple environments
    strategy:
      # A matrix build strategy to test against multiple versions of Node.js
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x]  # Tests the application with Node.js versions 14.x and 16.x

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so the job can access it
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Clones the repository to the runner

    - # Sets up the specified version of Node.js
      name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}  # Names the step with the Node.js version being used
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1  # Sets up the Node.js environment
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}  # Specifies the Node.js version from the matrix

    - # Installs node modules as specified in the project's package-lock.json
      run: npm ci  # Installs dependencies exactly as defined in package-lock.json

    - # This command will only run if a build script is defined in the package.json
      run: npm run build --if-present  # Runs the build script if it exists, skips otherwise

    - # Runs tests as defined in the project's package.json
      run: npm test  # Executes the test script defined in package.json
